Printing and Debugging
======================

When creating longer, more complex data flows printing and debugging 
is often necessary. **nuts-flow** provides methods for this purpose. 


Print
-----

Typical data flows are largely composed of pure functions without 
side-effects and only the final result is accessible. 
To display intermediate results the ``Print`` nut can be used:

 >>> from nutsflow import *
 >>> Range(3) >> Print() >> Consume()
 0
 1
 2
      
``Print`` takes a format parameter (either a 
`format string <https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#formatstrings>`_
or a function) that allows to tailor its output

 >>> Range(3) >> Print('number: {}') >> Consume()
 number: 0
 number: 1
 number: 2
 
 >>> Range(3) >> Print(lambda x: 'odd : %s' % bool(x % 2)) >> Consume()
 odd : False
 odd : True
 odd : False
   
``Print`` furthermore supports to print every *n-ths* element, print at
certain time intervals, or filter for the elements to be displayed:
   
 >>> Range(6) >> Print(every_n=2) >> Consume()
 1
 3
 5
 
 >>> Range(6) >> Sleep(1.0) >> Print(every_sec=1.5) >> Consume()
 1
 3
 5
 
 >>> Range(6) >> Print(filterfunc=lambda x: x > 2) >> Consume()
 3
 4
 5
   
``Sleep()`` waits for the given time in seconds and allows to slow
down the processing.

For long running flows printing progress information can be displayed
by inserting a ``PrintProgress`` nut. It, however, requires that the
number of elements to be processed is known beforehand.

>>> n = 10
>>> Range(n) >> Sleep(0.1) >> PrintProgress(n, update=0.1) >> Consume() # doctest: +SKIP
progress: 100%

  
Limit data
----------

Instead of printing intermediate results the size of data flow
can be limited by processing only a portion of the data. The
``Take(n)`` nut takes the first *n* elements only:

>>> Range(1000) >> Take(3) >> Collect()
[0, 1, 2]
  
Alternatively the ``Head(n)`` nut can be used that takes *n*
elements and collects them:

>>> Range(1000) >> Head(3)
[0, 1, 2]

The last elements of a flow can be captured by ``Tail`` but note
that the entire flow is consumed:

>>> Range(1000) >> Tail(3)
[997, 998, 999]
  
Finally, ``Pick(n)`` allows to pick every *n-th* element:
  
>>> Range(1000) >> Pick(100) >> Collect()
[0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900]

  
No Operation
------------

**nuts-flow** provides a ``NOP(nut)`` nut that can be used to quickly
and temporarily disable the evaluation of a nut in a flow.

>>> Range(5) >> Square() >> Collect()  # compute squares
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
>>> Range(5) >> NOP(Square()) >> Collect()  # Square disabled
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
  
This is often more convenient that commenting-out or temporarily
removing a nut for debugging purposes. Note that only single nuts
can be disabled with this method.


Conditional
-----------

Individual nuts in a flow can also be disabled/enabled or replaced
depending on a boolean flag using the ``If(cond, if_nut, else_nut)`` nut:

>>> [1, 2, 3] >> If(True, Square()) >> Collect()
[1, 4, 9]
>>> [1, 2, 3] >> If(False, Square()) >> Collect()
[1, 2, 3]

>>> [1, 2, 3] >> If(False, Square(), Take(1)) >> Collect()
[1]

Again this is largely of interest for debugging and limited to
operate on single nuts.  
  

Counter
-------

Sometimes only the number of elements processed at a certain stage
is of interest. ``Counter`` is a nut with the needed side-effect:

>>> count = Counter('cnt')
>>> Range(10) >> count >> Square() >> Sum()
285
>>> count.value
10
  
Note that ``Counter`` does not modify the data flow. ``Counter`` also
has a filter function to count only certain elements:

>>> greater5 = Counter('gt5', filterfunc = lambda x: x > 5)
>>> Range(10) >> Square() >> greater5 >> Collect()
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
>>> greater5
gt5 = 7
  
Note that the actual value of the counter is stored in ``value`` and can 
be printed but for conveniency ``print greater5`` prints the name of the 
counter and its value as well.
