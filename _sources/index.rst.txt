**nuts-flow** is a flow-programming framework based on the chaining of 
iterators using the ``>>`` operator. Here a small example

>>> from nutsflow import Range, Filter, Take, Collect, _
>>> Range(10) >> Filter(_ > 5) >> Take(3) >> Collect()
[6, 7, 8]

For a quick start have a look at the :ref:`Introduction` and for
more detailed information see the :ref:`Tutorial` . Skim over the
short description of all nuts in the :ref:`Overview` for an
overall impression of the available functionality.
